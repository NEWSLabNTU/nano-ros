title: Unbounded message sequences capped at 64 elements

Generated message bindings use `heapless::Vec<T, N>` for unbounded sequences
(`uint8[] data`, `float32[] ranges`, etc.). The capacity `N` is hardcoded in
the codegen at **64 elements** (`NROS_DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_CAPACITY` in
`packages/cli/rosidl-codegen/src/types.rs`, line 490). The C/C++ generators
mirror this default (`C_DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_CAPACITY` at line 970,
`CPP_DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_CAPACITY` at line 1125, both `= 64`). It is a plain
compile-time `const` with no environment variable or attribute override.

This creates a fundamental mismatch for messages with large variable-length
payloads:

| Message                   | Field              | Typical size          | Generated capacity |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| `sensor_msgs/Image`       | `uint8[] data`     | 921,600 (640×480 RGB) | 64 bytes           |
| `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` | `uint8[] data`     | 10,000+               | 64 bytes           |
| `sensor_msgs/LaserScan`   | `float32[] ranges` | 360–1080              | 64 floats          |
| `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`  | `int8[] data`      | 10,000+               | 64 bytes           |

**Problem**: `heapless::Vec<u8, 65536>` would support 64 KB images, but the
backing `[MaybeUninit<u8>; 65536]` **always occupies 64 KB** on the stack
regardless of actual content. On MCUs with 64–256 KB total RAM, this is
unacceptable.

Bounded sequences (`uint8[<=100] data`, i.e. `[<=N]`) are handled distinctly
— they use the declared bound as the capacity and do not suffer from the
default-capacity problem.

**Impact**: Large sensor messages (Image, PointCloud2, LaserScan) are
effectively unusable on embedded targets with the current codegen.
Deserialization fails with `DeserError::CapacityExceeded` when the incoming
data exceeds 64 elements.

**Design direction — borrowed deserialization (zero-copy)**:

Instead of copying sequence data into the message struct, generate a
borrowed message type where unbounded sequences are `&'a [u8]` slices
pointing directly into the CDR receive buffer:

```rust
// Current: copies data into fixed inline buffer (64 bytes max)
struct Image {
    height: u32,
    width: u32,
    encoding: heapless::String<32>,
    data: heapless::Vec<u8, 64>,  // 64 bytes on stack, always
}

// Proposed: borrows data from transport buffer (16 bytes on stack)
struct Image<'a> {
    height: u32,
    width: u32,
    encoding: heapless::String<32>,
    data: &'a [u8],  // pointer + length, points into CDR buffer
}
```

The deserializer reads the CDR sequence length header, then returns a slice
into the receive buffer at the correct offset — no copy, no fixed capacity.
The message struct is small and fixed-size. The payload can be arbitrarily
large, bounded only by the transport buffer size (`NROS_SUBSCRIPTION_BUFFER_SIZE`).

This works for any sequence field, not just the last one — the CDR
deserializer knows each field's offset. The lifetime `'a` ties the message
to the receive buffer scope (valid for the duration of the subscription
callback).

**Implementation approach**:

1. Add a `borrowed` codegen mode alongside the current `owned` mode.
   `owned` generates `heapless::Vec<T, N>` (current behavior, for small
   messages). `borrowed` generates `&'a [T]` for unbounded sequences.
2. The subscription callback receives `Image<'_>` with data borrowing
   the CDR buffer. The message is valid only inside the callback.
3. For non-byte sequences (`float32[] ranges`), alignment must be
   verified — CDR guarantees alignment, but the slice cast from
   `&[u8]` to `&[f32]` needs validation on strictly-aligned platforms.
4. Transport buffer size becomes the effective message size limit,
   configurable per-subscription via `NROS_SUBSCRIPTION_BUFFER_SIZE`.

**Workarounds available today**:

- Define bounded message types for the application's actual payload
  size (e.g., `uint8[<=4096] data` in a custom `.msg` file).
- Use raw CDR APIs (`try_recv_raw`) to access the receive buffer
  directly, bypassing the generated message types entirely.
