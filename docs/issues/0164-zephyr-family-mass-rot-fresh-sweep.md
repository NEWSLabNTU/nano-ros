## Summary

The first FULL `just zephyr build-fixtures` sweep in a long time (during #161)
plus a `tests/zephyr.rs` family run: **16 passed / 29 failed / 1 skipped**.
The family had been "passing" on museum binaries that predate several reworks;
fresh images expose accumulated rot. Categorized:

### (a) Stale test markers — proven, mechanical to fix (the #157 class)

- `test_zephyr_c_service_server_to_client_e2e` (zenoh): the client PRINTS
  `Result of add_two_ints: 5` (delivery works); the test waits/asserts
  `"Result:"` which matches nothing. Same for the cpp variant and the other
  `"Result:"`/`"[OK]"` sites — ~6 occurrences in `zephyr.rs`
  (`nros_tests::output::SERVICE_RESULT_PREFIX` is the canonical marker).
- `test_zephyr_dds_cpp_{talker,listener,service_server,service_client}_boots`:
  the images boot and publish immediately (`Publishing: 'Hello World: 1'`,
  `session_open: domain=56` — the #161 bake visibly working); the tests grep
  pre-277 banners (`"nros Zephyr C++ Talker"` …) that phase-277 slimmed out.

### (b) Pure-Rust zenoh/xrce images have no backend — issue #163

`test_zephyr_talker_to_listener_e2e`, `test_zephyr_rust_service_e2e`,
`test_zephyr_action_e2e`, `test_zephyr_to_native_e2e`,
`test_zephyr_server_native_client`, `test_zephyr_xrce_rust_*` — all consume
`rs-*-{zenoh,xrce}` images, which since phase-248/249 contain no
`nros_rmw_{zenoh,xrce}_register` (see 0163). Freshly built images fail loudly
at `Executor::open`. Blocked on 0163's decision; not separately debuggable.

### (c) Untriaged — need their own look

- `test_zephyr_xrce_{c,cpp}_*` (talker/listener/service/action + cpp boots):
  C/C++ xrce images DO carry the backend (libnros_c.a) — could be more stale
  markers, the documented xrce runtime-lane debt, or real. Triage first
  against the marker list.
- `test_zephyr_dds_{c,cpp}_action_e2e`, `test_zephyr_dds_rs_action_e2e`:
  cyclone action lanes; phase_118 does not cover actions, so these have no
  recent LKG on fresh images.
- `test_zephyr_workspace_entry_native_sim_e2e`: west-lane zenoh entry image;
  listener side times out (`Listener timed out: Timeout` at 40 s). The entry
  images use the `nros_ws_runtime` umbrella (not the #163-affected app shape),
  so this is a distinct signal.

## Suggested order

1. Marker sweep (a) — mechanical, unlocks true signal for the rest.
2. Re-run family; re-categorize (c) with markers fixed.
3. (b) resolves with #163.

## Progress

**Step 1 (marker sweep) — DONE.** All stale markers in `zephyr.rs` fixed against
ground-truth example sources (compile-verified; runtime re-run still owed on a
built zephyr fixture host):

- **`"Result:"` → `SERVICE_RESULT_PREFIX`** ("Result of add_two_ints:", what
  `AddTwoIntsClient.cpp` actually prints): `test_zephyr_c_service_server_to_client_e2e`
  (zenoh) + `test_zephyr_xrce_c_service_e2e`.
- **`"[OK]"` / `"sum="` → `SERVICE_RESULT_PREFIX`**:
  `test_zephyr_xrce_cpp_service_e2e` + `test_zephyr_cpp_service_server_to_client_e2e`
  (the bogus `sum=` fallback dropped — no example prints it).
- **pre-277 `"nros Zephyr C++ <Role>"` boot banner → `"Booting Zephyr OS"`**
  (the kernel banner, the marker the passing `dds_c` `_boots` tests already use;
  phase-277 W5 removed the C++ banner — no source prints it anymore): all four
  `test_zephyr_dds_cpp_{talker,listener,service_server,service_client}_boots`, both
  `test_zephyr_xrce_cpp_{talker,listener}_boots`, and the stale-banner else-arm in
  `test_zephyr_cpp_talker_to_listener_e2e`.

**Step 2 (re-run + re-categorize) — DONE 2026-07-09.** Provisioned the host
(`just zephyr setup`, doctor OK), built all 66 fixtures, and ran the full
`--test zephyr` family TWICE — once before and once after #163's fix landed
upstream (the pre-#163 run's 15 `Executor::open ConnectionFailed` on the rust
lanes is obsolete; #163 is now resolved). Post-#163 result: **21 passed / 24
failed / 1 skipped**.

Marker sweep **validated**: 7 flips fail→pass (six C++ `_boots` now on
`"Booting Zephyr OS"`; `c_service_server_to_client_e2e` on `SERVICE_RESULT_PREFIX`).

Re-categorized the 24 remaining fails:

- **#163 (resolved) — rust `xrce` lanes now PASS** (gone from the fail list):
  `xrce_rust_{talker_listener,service,action}` green (the XRCE `host:port`
  locator bake + force-link register).
- **Staleness-guard false-positive (#147 class) — the rust `zenoh` lanes +
  workspace-entry**: `test_zephyr_{talker,listener,service_*}_smoke`,
  `rust_service_e2e`, `talker_to_listener_e2e`, `to_native`, the native↔zephyr
  crosses, and `workspace_entry_native_sim_e2e` all fail with `Zephyr fixture
  binary is stale: …/build-rs-*-zenoh/zephyr/zephyr.exe`. The images EXIST and
  are functional — the incremental rebuild relinked only #163's xrce images, so
  the untouched zenoh images predate a bumped source and the source-mtime-vs-image
  heuristic false-rejects them. A `--force` (clean) rebuild clears it; clean CI
  never hits it. Not an RMW failure — a resolver-heuristic fragility.
- **(c-XRCE C/C++) — real 0-delivery**: `xrce_{c,cpp}_{talker_listener,service,
  action}` (`client OK=0, server requests=0` / `got no reply`). The agent starts;
  the `libnros_c` XRCE path does not deliver on native_sim. Untouched by #163
  (that fix was the pure-Rust images). **Actionable residual.**
- **(c-cyclone completion) — `dds_{c,cpp,rs}_action` + `cpp_service_server_to_client`**:
  action = `server_received_goal=true, client_completed=false`; cpp service =
  `client OK=1` of 3 expected. Cyclone native_sim server RECEIVES but the
  result/completion round-trip is lossy. phase_118 covers only pub/sub, so no LKG.
  **Actionable residual.**
- **Residual (a) folded in**: the cpp service tests' server-side
  `count_pattern(server_output, "Request")` was itself a stale marker (the server
  prints `"Incoming request"` = `SERVICE_INCOMING_REQUEST_MARKER`); fixed here so
  the cyclone-completion diagnostic reads true instead of "server requests=0".

**Net:** (a) done + validated; (b) resolved via #163 (rust lanes green, modulo
the local staleness artifact); the live residuals are now their own issues —
**XRCE-C/C++ delivery → #174** and **cyclone action/service completion → #175**
(and the zephyr-pub→native-sub delivery bug below → **#173**).

**Update (phase-286 W1 slice 3, 2026-07-09) — zephyr-pub → native-sub delivery.**
Converting the rust pubsub cross tests to per-test ephemeral routers (for
parallelism) let them actually RUN past the staleness guard, and exposed a
distinct delivery bug: a **Zephyr publisher's samples never reach a native
subscriber** through the shared zenoh router. `zephyr_to_native_e2e` fails the
same way SERIALLY (native listener logs 0 `Received:` from the Zephyr talker), and
`bidirectional_native_zephyr_e2e` pins the asymmetry inside ONE router —
Native→Zephyr delivered 41 samples while Zephyr→Native delivered 0. Zephyr↔Zephyr
(`zephyr_talker_to_listener_e2e`) and Native→Zephyr both work, so it is
specifically the zephyr-pico **publisher → host-zenohd → native-subscriber** path.
Not a port/parallelism artifact (fails serial). Own follow-up.

## Fresh sweep 2026-07-12 — mass-rot drained to 5 stale-fixtures + 2 real residuals

Full `--test zephyr` on current main (NO `NROS_SKIP_FIXTURE_CHECK`): **38 passed /
7 failed / 1 skipped** (was 21/24/1 at filing). The spun-off issues all landed:
#163 (backend), #147/W2 (content-aware staleness), #174 (XRCE C/C++), #175 (Cyclone
action, all lanes), #173 (zephyr-pub→native — was a stale Int32-vs-String listener
fixture). The 7 remaining fails:

- **5 = stale-fixture errors** (the guard working, not bugs): `dds_{c,cpp,rs}_action_e2e`,
  `zephyr_server_native_client`, `native_server_zephyr_client` — the guard reports
  e.g. `native-rs-service-client` binary older than
  `generated/builtin_interfaces/src/lib.rs` (a codegen mtime bump; the classic
  treadmill). Proven to PASS when rebuilt (the 3 action lanes were verified fresh in
  #175). Fix = `just build-test-fixtures`.
- **2 = ~~real residuals~~ TEST BUGS, both fixed 2026-07-12:**
  - `cpp_service_server_to_client_e2e` (zenoh) — **RESOLVED**: NOT a throughput
    shortfall. `AddTwoIntsClient` is a ONE-SHOT (`on_tick` sends one request, prints
    one `Result of add_two_ints:`, sets `done_`) — identical to the C sibling, whose
    test asserts `>= 1`. The cpp test asserted `>= 3` (a stale "4 calls" comment),
    which is unsatisfiable by design. Delivery of the 1 reply works. Fixed the
    assertion to `>= 1`; test PASSES (35.7 s).
  - `workspace_entry_native_sim_e2e` — **RESOLVED 2026-07-12**: NOT a delivery race
    (an earlier note here was wrong). A **message-type mispair** — the ws demo Entry
    (`talker_pkg`) publishes `std_msgs/Int32` on `/chatter` while the test observer
    (`examples/native/rust/listener`) subscribed `std_msgs/String`; rmw_zenoh bakes
    the type into the keyexpr so the router never matched. Same class as #173 (the
    07-06 String migration of the shared listener fixed the String-talker tests but
    exposed this Int32-demo test). Fix: the native listener's type is now
    `NROS_SUB_TYPE`-selectable and the ws-entry test sets `int32`. Test PASSES (49 s).

**Net:** the "mass rot" is cleared. Both non-stale fails were TEST bugs (ws-entry
observer type mispair + cpp-service over-assertion), now fixed and individually
PASSING. The remaining 5 fails are stale-fixture guard errors — mechanical
`just build-test-fixtures`. After that rebuild the family should be fully green
(44 pass / 1 skip). No RMW code defects remain in this family; close #164 once a
fresh full-fixture sweep confirms green.
