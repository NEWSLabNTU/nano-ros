# Phase 177 - Build/Test Issue Tracker

**Goal.** Track known build and test issues found during the 2026-05-20/21
post-refactor sweeps of `main`. Use this file as an issue tracker:
open items stay in "Known issues"; completed items move to "Closed".

**Scope.** `just setup`, `just ci`, `just build-all`, and the `test-all`
tail. Issues owned by a more specific phase are linked here but should be
resolved in that owning phase.

**Current status.** Phase 171 is archived and this tracker now owns the
remaining build/test cleanup. Build quality gates are green after the
follow-up fixes, but the full runtime `test-all` layer still has
environment/setup and E2E failures that need focused owners. Latest
171.F.1 root `just ci` attempt (2026-05-22, with
`NROS_ZEPHYR_BUILD_ROOT=/home/aeon/repos/nano-ros/build/zephyr-workspace-builds`)
passed static checks, RTOS link check, Cyclone CI, doctests, Miri, C
codegen, and orchestration E2E, then failed in `test-all` with 39 real
failures plus 8 environment skips.

## Setup Contract

Run the full sweep in this order:

- [x] `just setup`
- [x] `just build-test-fixtures`
- [ ] `just test-all`

`test-all` should consume fixture binaries built by
`just build-test-fixtures`; it should not spend its runtime compiling
examples. Rust fixture lookup must use the `nros-fast-release` Cargo
profile directory, C/C++ fixture lookup must use the matching CMake
`build-<rmw>` directory, and missing host tools should skip with an
actionable setup remedy instead of surfacing as product failures.

The 2026-05-22 rerun followed this setup sequence. `just setup` passed,
`just build-test-fixtures` passed, and the follow-up `just test-all`
completed with 960 tests run: 911 passed, 49 failed, and 9 skipped.
Doctests, Miri, C codegen, C message generation, and orchestration E2E
passed.

## Known Issues

### Build/Feature Ownership

- [x] **177.3 - Cyclone CMake/Corrosion path for Rust examples.**
  Closed 2026-05-25 by the merged Phase 175 work.
  `nros_rmw_cyclonedds_register` lives only in the C++/CMake build, so
  `cargo build --features rmw-cyclonedds` of native/freertos/threadx
  Rust examples cannot link it directly; Cyclone-backed fixtures must go
  through the CMake/Corrosion path. Phase 175 landed that path for native
  Rust and added embedded Cyclone fixture wiring for FreeRTOS and ThreadX.
  FreeRTOS Rust Cyclone boots and exchanges user data. ThreadX RISC-V64
  now builds the Cyclone `ddsc` static-library probe and links the C,
  C++, and Rust talker/listener fixtures. The original build/link
  ownership issue is closed; remaining ThreadX runtime diagnosis is
  tracked separately under 177.22.

- [x] **177.22 - ThreadX Cyclone participant init runtime trap.**
  Owner: Phase 177 runtime/Cyclone follow-up.
  Closed 2026-05-25. ThreadX RISC-V64 Cyclone fixtures build, link, boot,
  create the C talker publisher, and publish repeatedly without trapping.
  The 2026-05-24 manual two-QEMU probe boots ThreadX, initializes NetX Duo
  and BSD sockets, then reports `nros_support_init -> -1` on the listener;
  the talker traps with `mcause=0x7` at picolibc tinystdio
  `__file_str_put` (`mepc=0x80074270`, `mtval=0x10016c008`,
  `tinystdio/filestrput.c:44`). Phase 175 fixed the prerequisite
  allocation/link issues (`z_malloc`/`z_free`, C++ `new/delete`,
  Cyclone session-state allocation, and `stderr` binding). The runtime fix
  moves the Cyclone log buffer off ThreadX TLS, provides the board IPv4
  address to Cyclone, treats unsupported NetX socket options as
  unsupported instead of dereferencing TCP-only state, avoids the ThreadX
  socket waitset self-pipe path, disables the optional CDR stream
  optimization precompute on ThreadX, registers the C talker descriptor
  explicitly instead of relying on constructors, and uses Cyclone's `ddsrt`
  heap for transient publish samples. The focused verification was:
  `just cyclonedds threadx-cross-probe`, a sourced ROS rebuild of
  `riscv64_threadx_c_talker`, and a 20-second QEMU run showing
  `Publisher created for topic: /chatter` followed by `Published: 0..18`.
  The QEMU filter-dump pcap remains empty because the ThreadX Cyclone
  profile now disables multicast discovery; peer interop traffic is a
  separate follow-up tracked under 177.26, not the participant-init trap.

- [ ] **177.26 - ThreadX Cyclone peer interop / multicast discovery.**
  Owner: Phase 177 runtime/Cyclone follow-up. Split out of 177.22
  (participant-init trap, closed). The ThreadX RISC-V64 Cyclone C talker
  boots, creates the publisher, and publishes locally, but no two-node
  ThreadX↔ThreadX or ThreadX↔native RTPS exchange has been demonstrated.

  **2026-05-25 — discovery re-enabled, surfaced a byte-order defect.**
  - Flipped the ThreadX Cyclone profile from `<AllowMulticast>false</AllowMulticast>`
    to `spdp` (`packages/dds/nros-rmw-cyclonedds/src/session.cpp`). The
    board already enables IGMPv2 (`nx_igmp_enable`) and the virtio-net
    driver accepts all multicast on RX, so this is the right discovery
    path; data stays unicast.
  - Added a two-QEMU AF_UNIX-dgram e2e (shared L2, no slirp isolation):
    `packages/testing/nros-tests/tests/threadx_riscv64_qemu.rs::test_threadx_riscv64_cyclonedds_two_qemu_pubsub`.
    `#[ignore]`d until the bug below is fixed. Talker `10.0.2.40`/`:56`,
    listener `10.0.2.41`/`:57` (already distinct via each `config.toml`,
    applied through `startup.c` → `nros_board_set_network_config`).
  - One run confirmed SPDP discovery is now *attempted* (was fully
    suppressed before), but every write fails:
    `tev: ddsi_udp_conn_write to udp/1.0.255.239:7400 failed with retcode -12`.
    The listener also aborts at
    `nros_executor_register_subscription -> -1`.

  **Diagnosis — final, instrumentation-verified 2026-05-25.** The board's
  `nx_port.h` *does* define real `htonl`/`ntohl` (`__builtin_bswap32`), and
  `NX_IP_CLASS_D_TYPE = 0xE0000000` (`nx_api.h:991`); instrumentation of the
  two-QEMU dgram run pinned **two** real defects in the ThreadX ddsrt port
  (`src/ddsrt/src/sockets/threadx/socket.c`), both since fixed:

  1. **IGMP join byte order.** `setsockopt(IPPROTO_IP, IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP)`
     returned `EINVAL`. Cyclone hands the multicast group to the BSD layer
     in *host* byte order (`maddr=0xefff0001`) while NetX's class-D check
     `imr_multiaddr & ntohl(NX_IP_CLASS_D_TYPE)` expects *network* order
     (`nxd_bsd.c:7124`); `0xefff0001 & 0x000000e0 = 0 ≠ 0xe0` → reject. The
     interface address (`0x2902000a`) already arrived network-ordered. Fix:
     normalise `imr_multiaddr` to network byte order in `ddsrt_setsockopt`.
  2. **Multi-iovec datagram send.** SPDP/RTPS `ddsi_udp_conn_write` failed
     with `-12` (`EDESTADDRREQ`/`ENOTCONN`). RTPS messages are multi-iovec
     (header + submessages), so `ddsrt_sendmsg` fell into the per-iov
     `nx_bsd_send` loop, which is a *connected* send with **no destination**
     — wrong for connectionless UDP. Fix: when a destination is present,
     coalesce the iovecs into one buffer and `nx_bsd_sendto` once (also
     applying the multicast byte-order swap to the destination).

  Both fixes are committed in the cyclonedds fork (`NEWSLabNTU/cyclonedds`
  branch `nano-ros/zephyr-nsos-patches`, local commit `e8ce7315`). **Not yet
  pushed / superproject pointer not bumped** — the agent is not permitted to
  push the external fork; a maintainer must push it and bump the submodule
  pointer. The earlier byte-order/multicast-egress write-ups in this item
  were partially wrong (the diagnosis zig-zagged); this block supersedes
  them.

  **Verified.** With the fixes, the ThreadX RISC-V64 Cyclone C talker joins
  the SPDP group and publishes 24/24 with **zero** `conn_write` errors over
  a two-QEMU AF_UNIX-dgram link. Multicast discovery TX is working.

  **Remaining blocker (distinct subsystem, pre-existing).** The listener
  still aborts at `nros_executor_register_subscription -> -1`. Instrumentation
  shows the backend `subscriber_create` is **never reached** — the failure is
  in the nano-ros Rust executor `register_subscription_raw_with_qos_sized`
  (`packages/core/nros-c/src/executor.rs:771`) *before* the Cyclone create,
  i.e. an arena/capacity allocation for the subscription's
  `MESSAGE_BUFFER_SIZE` buffer. This is orthogonal to multicast discovery and
  reproduced on the first run before any of the above changes (the talker
  registers no subscription, so it never hits it). Two-node RTPS stays
  unproven until the subscriber can be created.

  **Next.**
  1. Maintainer: push cyclonedds `e8ce7315`, bump the submodule pointer.
  2. Diagnose the Rust executor subscription-register failure (arena sizing
     vs capacity) for the ThreadX Cyclone listener fixture; likely a
     `NROS_EXECUTOR_ARENA_SIZE` / `MESSAGE_BUFFER_SIZE` mismatch in the
     listener build config, not a Cyclone/NetX issue.
  3. Re-run the `#[ignore]`d test (`--ignored`); only a decoded sample on the
     listener proves two-node RTPS.

- [ ] **177.27 - ThreadX-Linux C/C++ CycloneDDS fixtures fail to build.**
  Found 2026-05-25 while staging fixtures for 177.9.H. When Cyclone is set
  up (`build/install/lib/libddsc.so` + `bin/idlc` present),
  `just threadx_linux build-fixtures` adds the `cyclonedds` RMW to the C/C++
  fixture matrix, but the build fails: `nros_rmw_cyclonedds_generate_from_msg
  requires msg_to_cyclone_idl.py — set NROS_RMW_CYCLONEDDS_SCRIPTS_DIR`. The
  script exists at `scripts/cyclonedds/msg_to_cyclone_idl.py`; the
  `build-fixture-extras` recipe in `just/threadx-linux.just` simply does not
  export `NROS_RMW_CYCLONEDDS_SCRIPTS_DIR` (nor pass
  `-DNROS_RMW_CYCLONEDDS_MSG_TO_IDL=`) for the cyclonedds cmake invocations,
  and `parallel --halt now,fail=1` then aborts the whole fixture build. The
  zenoh fixtures are unaffected (built directly to unblock 177.9.H). Likely a
  one-line export in the recipe, plus verification that the threadx-linux
  C/C++ cyclonedds fixtures then build and the corresponding `rtos_e2e`
  cyclonedds cases run. Sibling of 177.24 (Zephyr CycloneDDS fixtures) but a
  distinct root cause (script-path wiring vs chrono shim).

### Test-All Environment / Setup

- [x] **177.6 - PX4 tests require explicit PX4 workspace setup.**
  `test-all` failures include missing or invalid `PX4_AUTOPILOT_DIR`.
  Fixed: `just/sdk-env.just` now provides the repo-local default
  `PX4_AUTOPILOT_DIR`, `.env.example` documents position-independent
  overrides, and PX4 tests consume only that environment variable with
  the exact setup remedy when it is invalid.

- [x] **177.7 - ESP-IDF and PlatformIO host tools missing.**
  ESP-IDF and PlatformIO groups require `idf.py` and `pio`; the minimal
  sweep environment did not provide them. Fixed: the ESP-IDF smoke
  detects the env shim path supplied by `NROS_ESP_IDF_ENV_SHIM`, and
  `just/sdk-env.just` defines the default ESP-IDF workspace, env shim, and
  user-local tool PATH used by PlatformIO. `.env.example` documents
  overrides, while `.envrc` remains optional direnv glue for loading
  `.env`. Full `just setup` already includes `platformio`, `esp_idf`,
  and `px4` in the `everything` tier.

- [ ] **177.8 - Full runtime matrix requires prebuilt fixtures.**
  The latest sweep was run after `just setup` and
  `just build-test-fixtures`, so the remaining fixture/setup failures are
  narrower than the original broad prebuild issue. Keep this item open
  until every fixture lookup uses the build-fixture artifact layout and
  every optional host dependency reports a precise skip/remedy.

- [x] **177.24 - Zephyr CycloneDDS fixtures fail after Cyclone setup.**
  Closed 2026-05-25 — already fixed by `4b1b0723d` ("test: replace fixed
  sleeps with readiness waits"), which the 2026-05-25 recheck below predated.
  The recorded blocker was `internal.hpp::platform_now_ms()` /
  `platform_sleep_ms()` falling into the `#else` branch that uses
  `std::chrono::steady_clock` / `std::this_thread::sleep_for`, which Zephyr's
  minimal `native_sim` C++ shim does not expose. `4b1b0723d` added explicit
  `NROS_PLATFORM_ZEPHYR || __ZEPHYR__` branches that route through the C
  shim (`nros_platform_time_ns()` / `nros_platform_sleep_ms()`) and confined
  the `<chrono>` / `<thread>` includes to the non-RTOS `#else`. Because the
  Zephyr fixtures compile nros-rmw-cyclonedds through the Zephyr toolchain
  (`__ZEPHYR__` is always defined there), the embedded branch now engages and
  no chrono shim is pulled. Verified 2026-05-25 by building the CycloneDDS
  talker fixtures for all three languages — they compile and link clean:
  `NROS_ZEPHYR_FIXTURE_FILTER='build-cpp-talker-cyclonedds' just zephyr build-fixtures`
  then `NROS_ZEPHYR_FIXTURE_FILTER='build-(rs|c)-talker-cyclonedds' just zephyr build-fixtures`
  both report "Zephyr test fixtures built successfully" (nros-rmw-cyclonedds
  `session/sertype_min/publisher/subscriber/service/vtable.cpp` all build).
  Original recheck context retained: `just cyclonedds doctor` passes and the
  host artifacts exist at `build/install/bin/idlc` + `lib/libddsc.so`. This
  unblocks the CycloneDDS slice of 177.9.F (Zephyr E2E runtime).

### Test-All Runtime / E2E

- [ ] **177.9 - Runtime E2E failures need focused reruns.**
  The 2026-05-22 `test-all` rerun reported 960 tests run: 911 passed, 49
  failed, and 9 skipped after `just setup` and `just build-test-fixtures`
  both passed. The remaining failures are grouped below so owners can
  close them independently. Newer focused fixes closed 177.19 and 177.20;
  rerun these groups with required fixtures/services prebuilt and split
  remaining product bugs from host/setup fallout.

#### 2026-05-22 Failed Tests by Group

- [x] **177.9.A - Host tools, fixture gates, and explicit prerequisites.**
  Focused rerun on 2026-05-25:
  `cargo nextest run --cargo-profile nros-fast-release -p nros-tests
  --no-fail-fast --test bridge_xrce_to_dds_e2e --test
  bridge_zenoh_to_dds_e2e --test integration_esp_idf --test
  integration_px4 --test cpp_parameters`.
  Result: 3 passed, 2 environment-skipped, 0 real failures after applying
  the project `[SKIPPED]` classifier. The SDK-dependent tests were also
  rerun through `just _nextest-platform <test-binary>` so
  `just/sdk-env.just` provided the repo-local SDK defaults, and direct
  Cargo was verified with `source scripts/sdk-env.sh` before invoking
  `cargo nextest`.
  - [x] `bridge_xrce_to_dds_e2e::bridge_xrce_to_dds_starts_and_opens_both_sessions`
        now reports the missing retired source path explicitly; the old
        `examples/native/c/bridge/xrce-to-dds` tree is not present in the
        current collapsed examples layout.
  - [x] `bridge_zenoh_to_dds_e2e::bridge_zenoh_to_dds_starts_and_opens_both_sessions`
        now reports the missing retired source path explicitly; the old
        `examples/bridges/native-rust-zenoh-to-dds` tree is not present in
        the current collapsed examples layout.
  - [x] `integration_esp_idf::esp_idf_integration_shell_smoke` passes when
        run via `just`, which exports `NROS_ESP_IDF_ENV_SHIM` and
        `IDF_PATH` from `just/sdk-env.just`.
  - [x] `integration_px4::px4_integration_template_smoke` passes when run
        via `just`, which exports `PX4_AUTOPILOT_DIR` from
        `just/sdk-env.just`.
  - [x] `cpp_parameters::cpp_parameters_roundtrip` passes.

- [x] **177.9.B - Platform CMake, logging, and NuttX smoke coverage.**
  These are build/smoke edges inside the test layer, not the main
  `build-test-fixtures` prebuild path:
  The five environment skips from the focused 2026-05-25 rerun are not
  generic `just setup` misses. Four are intentionally deferred raw-CMake
  smoke cells whose real coverage lives in platform-aware recipes; the
  NuttX skip means `just nuttx build-fixtures-make` was not rerun after
  the local NuttX kernel was configured/built without nano-ros external
  apps.
  - [x] `cmake_platform_matrix::cmake_platform_freertos` is an intentional
        environment skip; the raw CMake smoke does not supply
        `FREERTOS_DIR` + `LWIP_DIR`, so FreeRTOS coverage stays in the
        platform recipes.
  - [x] `cmake_platform_matrix::cmake_platform_nuttx` is an intentional
        environment skip; NuttX builds through cargo / `just nuttx build`,
        not the raw CMake smoke.
  - [x] `cmake_platform_matrix::cmake_platform_threadx` is an intentional
        environment skip; ThreadX coverage is owned by the ThreadX Linux
        integration shell and board-aware recipes.
  - [x] `cmake_platform_matrix::cmake_platform_zephyr` is an intentional
        environment skip; Zephyr coverage is owned by west/module builds.
  - [x] `logging_smoke::logging_smoke_freertos_mps2_emits_every_severity`
        passes.
  - [x] `logging_smoke::logging_smoke_mps2_baremetal_emits_every_severity`
        passes.
  - [x] `logging_smoke::logging_smoke_nuttx_qemu_arm_emits_every_severity`
        passes.
  - [x] `logging_smoke::logging_smoke_threadx_linux_harness_captures_nros_log_stderr`
        passes after refreshing the ThreadX log writer in app-thread context
        and emitting each Linux stderr record with one host syscall.
  - [x] `logging_smoke::logging_smoke_threadx_riscv64_emits_every_severity`
        passes.
  - [x] `logging_smoke::logging_smoke_zephyr_native_sim_emits_every_severity`
        passes.
  - [x] `nuttx_make_e2e::nuttx_external_apps_link_into_kernel_binary`
        now classifies a configured kernel with zero nano-ros external-app
        symbols as a stale make fixture environment skip; partial symbol loss
        still fails.
  - [x] Focused verification:
        `cargo nextest run --cargo-profile nros-fast-release -p nros-tests
        --no-fail-fast --test cmake_platform_matrix --test logging_smoke
        --test nuttx_make_e2e` produced 9 passes, 5 environment skips, and
        `just _count-real-failures target/nextest/default/junit.xml` returned
        `0`.

- [x] **177.9.C - Native C/XRCE runtime.**
  Closed 2026-05-25. Initial focused rerun failed because the native C
  XRCE fixtures were not prebuilt:
  `examples/native/c/{talker,listener}/build-xrce/c_{talker,listener}`.
  After `just native build-fixtures`, the runtime-only C/XRCE group passed:
  `just native test-c-xrce verbose` reported 5 tests run, 5 passed, 0
  skipped.
  - [x] `c_xrce_api::test_c_xrce_listener_starts`
  - [x] `c_xrce_api::test_c_xrce_talker_listener_communication`
  - [x] `c_xrce_api::test_c_xrce_talker_starts`

- [x] **177.9.D - QEMU RTIC and QEMU zenoh/serial runtime.**
  Closed 2026-05-25. Not a runtime bug — every failure was a missing
  prebuilt fixture, and the fixture build itself was broken. The
  qemu-arm-baremetal examples wire `std_msgs` / `builtin_interfaces`
  through `[patch.crates-io] -> generated/` in their `.cargo/config.toml`,
  but `just qemu build-fixtures` ran `cargo build` without first running
  `nros generate-rust`, so cargo could not load the (gitignored) generated
  crates. The plain `listener`/`talker` build failed on the absent
  `generated/builtin_interfaces`, and `parallel --halt now,fail=1` then
  killed every in-flight fixture build — so none of the RTIC/serial/large-msg
  binaries the 177.9.D tests resolve were ever staged. Fixed by adding a
  codegen step (gated on `package.xml`) before `cargo build` in
  `just/qemu-baremetal.just::build-fixtures`, mirroring the native recipe's
  `ensure_native_rust_generated`. After `just qemu build-fixtures`, all six
  tests pass:
  `cargo nextest run -p nros-tests --no-fail-fast -E '(binary(emulator) and (test(test_qemu_rtic_pubsub_e2e) or test(test_qemu_rtic_service_e2e) or test(test_qemu_rtic_action_e2e) or test(test_qemu_rtic_mixed_priority_pubsub_e2e) or test(test_qemu_serial_pubsub_e2e))) or (binary(large_msg) and test(test_qemu_zenoh_large_publish))'`
  → `6 passed`.
  - [x] `emulator::test_qemu_rtic_action_e2e`
  - [x] `emulator::test_qemu_rtic_mixed_priority_pubsub_e2e`
  - [x] `emulator::test_qemu_rtic_pubsub_e2e`
  - [x] `emulator::test_qemu_rtic_service_e2e`
  - [x] `emulator::test_qemu_serial_pubsub_e2e`
  - [x] `large_msg::test_qemu_zenoh_large_publish`

- [x] **177.9.E - XRCE runtime.**
  Closed 2026-05-25. The XRCE harness now passes the canonical
  `NROS_LOCATOR` and enables `RUST_LOG=info` so `wait_for_output_*`
  observes the current env-logger markers. The service/action assertions
  were aligned with the current example output, and the multi-message
  test now waits for real `Received:` counts instead of a stale summary
  marker. Runtime fixes: the XRCE talker drives IO after each manual
  publish so repeated samples flush, and the action server periodically
  drives IO around goal accept/status/feedback/result work instead of
  relying on a typed action loop with no executor spin.
  Verification: `cargo nextest run --cargo-profile nros-fast-release -p
  nros-tests --no-fail-fast --test xrce` (14 passed, 0 skipped).
  - [x] `xrce::test_xrce_action_fibonacci`
  - [x] `xrce::test_xrce_multiple_messages`
  - [x] `xrce::test_xrce_service_request_response`
  - [x] `xrce::test_xrce_talker_listener_communication`

- [ ] **177.9.F - Zephyr native/cross E2E runtime.**
  Focused rerun on 2026-05-25:
  `NROS_ZEPHYR_BUILD_ROOT=/home/aeon/repos/nano-ros/build/zephyr-workspace-builds
  cargo nextest run --cargo-profile nros-fast-release -p nros-tests
  --no-fail-fast --test zephyr` with the 177.9.F Zenoh test filter.
  Result: 11/11 Zenoh tests passed after rebuilding native_sim fixtures
  with the shared NSOS overlay and per-language/per-role Zenoh locator
  Kconfig overrides. The prior `eth_posix: Cannot create zeth (0)`
  failure is gone; fixture logs report `Network ready (NSOS - host
  kernel sockets)`. C++ action also now emits the same `[OK]` success
  marker that the test harness waits for.

  XRCE follow-up on 2026-05-25 moved the Agent prerequisite into
  `just zephyr setup` and `just zephyr doctor`, then rebuilt the XRCE
  fixture subset with the NSOS overlay. The first live-agent run exposed
  stale fixture wiring: C and C++ XRCE tests start agents on per-language
  ports, but `just zephyr build-fixtures` was compiling every XRCE
  fixture against the default port 2018. The fixture matrix now passes
  `CONFIG_NROS_XRCE_AGENT_PORT` for each `(language, role)` cell:
  Rust 2018/2028/2038, C 2118/2128/2138, and C++ 2218/2228/2238.
  After rebuilding, the focused XRCE subset ran 7 tests: 2 passed and
  5 failed. Those 5 failures are no longer skipped setup fallout; they
  are runtime/backend issues after successful Agent/session setup.
  - [x] `test_bidirectional_native_zephyr_e2e` passes.
  - [x] `test_native_server_zephyr_client` passes.

  - [x] `test_zephyr_xrce_c_talker_listener` passes with `just zephyr setup`
        provided Agent and fixtures rebuilt against port 2118.
  - [x] `test_zephyr_xrce_rust_talker_listener` passes with `just zephyr setup`
        provided Agent and fixtures rebuilt against port 2018; the harness now
        accepts the Rust fixture's `Received[n]:` log format.
  - [ ] `test_zephyr_xrce_cpp_talker_listener` initializes and publishes on
        port 2218, but the C++ listener remains at "Waiting for messages" and
        receives no samples.
  - [ ] `test_zephyr_xrce_cpp_service_e2e` initializes on port 2228, but the
        client reports `0/4 calls succeeded` and the server logs no requests.
  - [ ] `test_zephyr_xrce_cpp_action_e2e` initializes on port 2238, but the
        client times out sending the goal with `Failed to send goal: -2`.
  - [ ] `test_zephyr_xrce_rust_service_e2e` still reports
        `Transport(ConnectionFailed)` on port 2028 even though pub/sub on
        port 2018 passes; inspect service fixture Kconfig/code path.
  - [ ] `test_zephyr_xrce_rust_action_e2e` still reports

- [x] **177.9.G - NuttX action E2E runtime.**
  Closed 2026-05-25. Focused rerun passed after building the required
  NuttX fixtures with the repo SDK environment:
  `source scripts/sdk-env.sh; just nuttx build-fixtures`, then
  `cargo nextest run --cargo-profile nros-fast-release -p nros-tests
  --test rtos_e2e --no-fail-fast -E "binary(rtos_e2e) and
  test(test_rtos_action_e2e::platform_2_Platform__Nuttx) and
  (test(lang_2_Lang__C) or test(lang_3_Lang__Cpp))"`. The setup needed
  `build/zenohd/zenohd` and `rust-src` for the pinned NuttX nightly so
  the C++ generated FFI crates could use `-Z build-std`.
  - [x] `rtos_e2e::test_rtos_action_e2e::platform_2_Platform__Nuttx::lang_2_Lang__C`
  - [x] `rtos_e2e::test_rtos_action_e2e::platform_2_Platform__Nuttx::lang_3_Lang__Cpp`

- [x] **177.9.H - Flaky but recovered.**
  Closed 2026-05-25. Not reproducible under focused rerun: after staging
  the ThreadX-Linux zenoh C++ fixtures
  (`examples/threadx-linux/cpp/{talker,listener}/build-zenoh/`), the test
  passed 17/17 consecutive runs (16 retries-off + 1 verbose), the verbose
  run showing the talker publishing 0..9+ and `messages received: 11`.
  Command:
  `cargo nextest run -p nros-tests --retries 0 -E 'binary(rtos_e2e) and test(test_rtos_pubsub_e2e::platform_3_Platform__ThreadxLinux::lang_3_Lang__Cpp)'`.
  The lone 2026-05-22 failure was a host-load hiccup during the heavy
  parallel `test-all` sweep, not a product bug. The post-sweep readiness
  gate (`ensure_ready` waits for the listener's "Waiting for messages"
  marker before the talker window, `4b1b0723d`) plus the test design
  (talker publishes repeatedly across a 15 s window, listener collects for
  30 s and needs only one message) make the discovery race non-fatal.
  - [x] `rtos_e2e::test_rtos_pubsub_e2e::platform_3_Platform__ThreadxLinux::lang_3_Lang__Cpp`

- [x] **177.19 - ESP32-C3 QEMU OpenETH Zenoh pub/sub does not move user data.**
  Fixed the ESP32-C3 QEMU Zenoh examples by sizing their generated
  executor arena for pub/sub instead of carrying the default action-capable
  74 KB arena on the main stack. The oversized stack-local `Executor`
  overflowed into adjacent `.bss`, clearing the smoltcp poll-callback
  slot after Ethernet init had registered it; runtime diagnostics showed
  `cb_registered=false` and `cb_sets=0` while `do_poll` climbed. The
  examples now set `NROS_EXECUTOR_ARENA_SIZE=16384` and trim Zenoh's
  unused UDP socket slots with `NROS_SMOLTCP_MAX_UDP_SOCKETS=2`. Focused
  verification passed:
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp TMPDIR=/tmp cargo test -p nros-tests --test esp32_emulator test_esp32_talker_listener_e2e -- --nocapture`
  (`1 passed`, `8.66s`).

### Code Review Findings (2026-05-25)

Post-merge review of the `db0e4fbb5` ThreadX Cyclone fix plus the build/test
re-org (`23c750514` just groups, `6fd5bd671`/`b38bcbadf` nextest profiles,
`6644372dd` focused native lanes). Functional today; items below are
robustness/consistency follow-ups, not regressions.

- [x] **177.23.A - `sertype_min.cpp` ThreadX guard fails open.**
  Fixed 2026-05-25. The CDR `opt_size_xcdr1/2` disable was gated on
  `#if DDSRT_WITH_THREADX` (`packages/dds/nros-rmw-cyclonedds/src/sertype_min.cpp`).
  That macro is Cyclone-internal — defined in the generated `dds/config.h`
  from `set(DDSRT_WITH_THREADX ${WITH_THREADX})` — and reached the TU only by
  transitive include, so if `config.h` ever left the include chain the `#if`
  evaluated 0, the optimization re-enabled, and the ThreadX ops-walker trap
  returned with **no compile error**. Now guarded on `NROS_PLATFORM_THREADX`,
  set explicitly `PRIVATE` on the target (`CMakeLists.txt:98`), matching the
  sibling `session.cpp`. The `#else` branch (non-ThreadX) is unchanged, so
  native/POSIX builds are unaffected.

- [x] **177.23.B - Two divergent fast-path test filters.**
  Fixed 2026-05-25. `just native test` (`just/native.just`) replaced the
  growing `not binary(...)` chain for the ROS 2 / XRCE-interop binaries with
  the `group(=ros2-interop)` + `group(=xrce_ros2_interop)` exclusion (same
  set as the old `params`/`rmw_interop`/`ros2_lifecycle_interop`/
  `xrce_ros2_interop` list, now drift-proof). The remaining explicit
  `binary(...)` excludes (`zephyr`, `esp32_emulator`, `large_msg`,
  `native_api`, `cpp_parameters`, `c_xrce_api`) are deliberate carve-outs
  with their own focused lane and no shared group. Unlike root `just test`,
  this lane intentionally keeps the QEMU RTOS e2e groups in, so it is not a
  verbatim copy of the root exclusion.

- [x] **177.23.C - just `[group(...)]` pass incomplete.**
  Fixed 2026-05-25. Added `[group(...)]` to the lifecycle recipes (setup/
  doctor → setup; build/test/clean/run → main; build-all/ci/*-fixtures/
  test-all → full-matrix; focused tests/probes → debug; kani/verus →
  verification) in the nine ungrouped module files (`just/workspace.just`,
  `verification.just`, `xrce.just`, `cyclonedds.just`, `rmw_zenoh.just`,
  `zenohd.just`, `docker.just`, `orin-spe.just`, `platformio.just`) — 65
  attrs total, matching the `freertos.just` convention (`default` + ad-hoc
  launchers stay ungrouped). **Root-recipe correction:** the root recipes
  flagged earlier (`build-test-fixtures-leaves`, `cyclonedds-ci`,
  `rust-rtos-link-check`, `check-*-mirror`, `check-example-matrix`,
  `format-{c,cpp,python}`, `check-{c,cpp,python}`, `build-workspace*`) are
  all `[private]`, so `just --list` already hides them — no grouping needed.

- [x] **177.23.D - "profile" name collides three concepts.**
  Fixed 2026-05-25. Review found **three** distinct "profile" concepts, not
  two: (1) the cargo build profile (`nros_nextest_profile_args` in
  `scripts/build/cargo.sh`, the `nros-fast-release` arg emitter — the worst
  offender), (2) the nextest run-profile `-P` (`nros_nextest_run_profile_*`),
  and (3) the recording overlay (`nros_nextest_profile_*`, `NROS_NEXTEST_PROFILE`,
  `.config/nextest-profile.toml`). Renamed (1) → `nros_cargo_nextest_args`
  (+ local var `cargo_nextest_args`) and (3) → `nros_nextest_record_*` /
  `NROS_NEXTEST_RECORD*` / `.config/nextest-record.toml`; (2) kept (already
  `run_`-prefixed). The recording path still leans on experimental nextest
  APIs (`store export`) — pin the nextest version when that surface
  stabilizes. Recording stays gated behind `NROS_NEXTEST_RECORD=1`, so
  normal runs are unaffected.

- [x] **177.23.E - Duplicate `177.22` item number.**
  Fixed 2026-05-25. Three items shared `177.22`: "ThreadX Cyclone
  participant init runtime trap" (kept — matches commit `db0e4fbb5` and the
  CLAUDE.md reference), "Zephyr CycloneDDS fixtures fail after Cyclone setup"
  (renumbered 177.24), and "Make `nros` the canonical build/test CLI"
  (renumbered 177.25).

## Closed

- [x] **177.25 - Make `nros` the canonical build/test CLI.**
  Closed 2026-05-25. Build and test recipes should not compile the
  `nros-cli` binary as a side effect, and should not use or provide the
  legacy `cargo nano-ros` command. Setup owns installing the canonical
  `nros` binary (`just setup base` via workspace cargo tools).
  Later stages resolve `nros` from `PATH` or `NROS_CLI=/path/to/nros`
  and fail with an actionable setup hint if it is missing. Root
  binding generation, native fixture generation, FreeRTOS examples, and
  the Zephyr Rust generated-dir preflight now use that canonical
  resolver. The old `cargo-nano-ros` package remains only as an internal
  Rust library until its codegen APIs are renamed or split; it no longer
  builds a Cargo subcommand binary.

- [x] **177.21 - `generate-bindings` should be incremental.**
  Closed 2026-05-24. Fixed with
  `scripts/build/generate-rust-incremental.sh`. Root `generate-bindings`
  now hashes the package manifest, local interface files, the built
  `nros` binary, ROS interface prefixes, and generator args before
  deciding whether to call `nros generate-rust --force`. Unchanged
  packages skip regeneration; package/interface/generator changes still
  force a refresh.

- [x] **177.2 - Remaining Cyclone Zephyr action gaps.**
  Closed 2026-05-23. Zephyr Cyclone DDS action examples now build and
  run end-to-end for C, C++, and Rust on `native_sim`. The fix adds a
  shared Zephyr CMake helper that generates and links the Cyclone DDS
  descriptors required by action endpoints:
  `builtin_interfaces/Time`, `unique_identifier_msgs/UUID`,
  `action_msgs/{GoalInfo,GoalStatus,GoalStatusArray,CancelGoal}`, and
  `example_interfaces/action/Fibonacci`. The action overlays also use
  NSOS host sockets and larger heap/pthread resources, avoiding the old
  zeth/TAP panic path. The test harness now treats Zephyr fixtures as
  prebuilt inputs and reports stale/missing binaries with the `just
  zephyr build-fixtures` remedy instead of building inside tests.
  Focused verification passed:
  `NROS_ZEPHYR_FIXTURE_FILTER='build-(rs|c|cpp)-action-(server|client)-cyclonedds' NROS_ZEPHYR_BUILD_JOBS=1 NROS_ZEPHYR_NINJA_JOBS=8 just zephyr build-fixtures`,
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp TMPDIR=/tmp cargo test -p nros-tests --test zephyr test_zephyr_dds_cpp_action_e2e -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`,
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp TMPDIR=/tmp cargo test -p nros-tests --test zephyr test_zephyr_dds_c_action_e2e -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`,
  and
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp TMPDIR=/tmp cargo test -p nros-tests --test zephyr test_zephyr_dds_rs_action_e2e -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`.
  The aemv8r/FVP reference path remains a separate platform
  re-verification item if that target is re-enabled.

- [x] **177.20 - QEMU MPS2 serial Zenoh pub/sub stalls inside publish path.**
  Fixed in the `zenoh-pico` submodule by starting publisher write filters
  open for `Z_FEATURE_MULTI_THREAD == 0` builds. Single-threaded embedded
  clients do not have a background read task to learn remote subscriber
  matches before the application's first write, so the previous default
  suppressed the first serial publish before it reached the router.
  Verified 2026-05-23 with
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp TMPDIR=/tmp cargo test -p nros-tests --test emulator test_qemu_serial_pubsub_e2e -- --nocapture`
  (`published=1, received=1`, 7.68 s).

### Closed in the original 2026-05-20/21 sweep

- [x] **177.1 - CycloneDDS Zephyr duplicate `NSOS_MID_IPPROTO_IP` case.**
  `native-sim-ipproto-ip-patch.sh` already added a complete IPPROTO_IP
  case to `nsos_adapt_setsockopt`; the redundant 11W.12 patch added a
  second label and caused `duplicate case value`. Fixed by making 11W.12
  skip when the case is already present. This was the original sole
  `build-all` blocker.

- [x] **177.4 - ESP-IDF setup git-ref corruption.**
  `scripts/esp_idf/setup.sh` used `fetch origin v5.3:v5.3`, which tried
  to write the annotated `v5.3` tag into `refs/heads/v5.3`. Fixed in
  `6be211ee4` with `fetch --depth 1 --tags origin <ref>` plus
  `checkout <ref>`.

- [x] **177.5 - NuttX/ESP32 `-Z build-std` e2e failures.**
  Verified green with pinned `nightly-2026-04-11` plus `rust-src`.
  Added `build_std_nightly_skip()` so missing toolchains skip with the
  exact remedy instead of failing with an opaque missing `core` error.

- [x] qemu `build-zenoh-pico.sh` missing
  `nros-platform-cffi/include` and `c/zpico` include paths.

- [x] `justfile build-workspace` needed to exclude no_std/C/C++ staticlib
  packages from the `nextest --no-run` line.

- [x] `nros/src/lib.rs` needed `sched_context` re-export gated on
  `rmw-cffi`.

- [x] `nros-c` / `nros-cpp` `build.rs` needed the picolibc `-isystem`
  include for riscv64-none `cc::Build`.

- [x] Stale pre-collapse `rust/{zenoh,dds}/<ex>` fixture paths were
  removed from native/freertos/threadx/nuttx recipes.

- [x] dust-dds Rust examples migrated to `nros-rmw-cyclonedds-sys`; bare
  metal fixture matrices reverted to zenoh-only.

- [x] Unified jobserver `gmake` to make-4.4 alias fixed the stray make
  4.3 fifo jobserver failure.

### Closed in the 2026-05-21 follow-up sweep

- [x] **177.10 - Invalid `just ci/build-all` command path.**
  `just ci/build-all` is not a recipe. The correct split is `just ci`
  for quality/test orchestration and `just build-all` for the build
  matrix.

- [x] **177.11 - Clippy doc-comment lazy continuation.**
  Fixed in `nros-rmw-cyclonedds-sys`.

- [x] **177.12 - Stale example build directories confused checks.**
  Removed generated `examples/**/build*` directories so example checks no
  longer recurse into nested Corrosion workspaces.

- [x] **177.13 - `nros-c` library tests missing platform log symbols.**
  Added weak fallback stubs for `nros_platform_log_write` and
  `nros_platform_log_flush`.

- [x] **177.14 - NuttX C/C++ opaque size asserts.**
  Size probing returned no usable constants for the custom target. The
  C/C++ build scripts now use committed NuttX fallback sizes when the
  probe returns empty or zero sizes.

- [x] **177.15 - Zephyr read-only workspace/cache failures.**
  The Zephyr recipe now uses repo-local writable build/cache roots when
  the sibling Zephyr workspace or toolchain cache path is read-only.

- [x] **177.16 - Zephyr native_sim read-only ccache temp path.**
  Zephyr's built-in `ccache` wrapper wrote under read-only
  `/run/user/.../ccache-tmp`. The recipe disables that path with
  `USE_CCACHE=0` while preserving the repo-controlled `sccache` compiler
  launcher.

- [x] **177.17 - Zephyr CycloneDDS compatibility gaps.**
  Added/fixed `steady_clock::time_point`, `THREAD_CUSTOM_DATA`, weak
  `nsos_adapt_getifaddrs`, and non-fatal Cortex-R Rust patch handling
  when upstream Kconfig is not writable.

- [x] **177.18 - Zephyr native_sim inherited fifo jobserver failure.**
  `just build-all` can run Zephyr under the unified make-4.4 fifo
  jobserver, but Zephyr native_sim's final runner link invokes
  CMake's `MAKE` cache entry from `scripts/native_simulator/Makefile`.
  Ubuntu make 4.3 aborts on `--jobserver-auth=fifo:...` with
  `invalid --jobserver-auth string`. Zephyr build recipes now prepend the
  repo-local `third-party/make` and pass `-DMAKE=<repo>/third-party/make/make`
  so the native_sim make hop uses GNU make 4.4 and remains on the shared
  jobserver.
