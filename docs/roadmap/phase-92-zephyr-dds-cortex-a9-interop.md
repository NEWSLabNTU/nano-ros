# Phase 92: Zephyr DDS talker↔listener interop on qemu_cortex_a9

**Goal**: Land a real talker→listener DDS pubsub interop test for the Zephyr `nros-rmw-dds` path that exercises Zephyr's native IP stack (the code path 95% of production Zephyr DDS deployments will run), without requiring `sudo` host setup or a vendored Zephyr SDK patch.

**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: Medium
**Depends on**: Phase 71.8 (cooperative DDS runtime + boot smoke tests landed)

## Overview

### Why this exists

Phase 71.8 landed the cooperative `NrosPlatformRuntime<ZephyrPlatform>` + `NrosUdpTransportFactory` plus the multicast primitives (`mcast_listen`/`mcast_read`/`mcast_send`). Boot smoke tests pass (`test_zephyr_dds_rust_{talker,listener}_boots`). What's missing is a real interop test that proves talker → listener pubsub works end-to-end on Zephyr.

Investigating that test surfaced two structural blockers on `native_sim`:

1. **NSOS doesn't forward IPv4 multicast to the host kernel.** Zephyr's `nsos_adapt_setsockopt` only translates `SOL_SOCKET` / `IPPROTO_TCP` / `IPPROTO_IPV6` options. `IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` returns `EOPNOTSUPP`, so SPDP discovery silently fails and the listener never sees the talker. Fixing this requires patching three upstream Zephyr files — workspace-side, not our tree.
2. **TAP (`eth_native_posix`) needs `sudo` zeth-bridge setup.** Phase 81's archived doc records the multi-instance contention (`Cannot create zeth0`) plus `pthread_create(NULL attr)` bug; the latter was fixed via `nros_zephyr_task_create`, but the per-instance TAP names + host bridge still need root.

The third option — `qemu_cortex_a9` with QEMU's `-netdev socket,mcast=…` — sidesteps both: 512 MB SRAM (comfortable for dust-dds's ~4 MB heap requirement), Xilinx GEM ethernet driver in Zephyr, full Zephyr IP stack with native IGMP, and QEMU's mcast netdev creates a virtual L2 segment by joining a host-local UDP multicast group (no privileges, no TAP). Two QEMU instances joined to the same mcast group exchange Ethernet frames as if on the same wire.

This is also the **same code-path topology that real Zephyr DDS deployments use**: native IP stack on a real Ethernet PHY (vs. NSOS-on-native-sim, which mirrors the niche offload-modem topology and is irrelevant to standard DDS-on-Zephyr).

```

`-netdev socket,id=net0,mcast=230.0.0.1:N` on each QEMU process joins the same host mcast group. QEMU forwards every frame the guest sends to that group; every frame received from the group is delivered to the guest. The two guests see each other as L2 neighbours. Zephyr's GEM driver sees a normal Ethernet link, and SPDP (RTPS multicast on `239.255.0.1:7400`) flows over the virtual segment.

## Work Items

- [x] 92.1 — Validate Cortex-A9 Rust toolchain
       Patched `modules/lang/rust/CMakeLists.txt` and `modules/lang/rust/Kconfig`
       upstream to add Cortex-A9/A7 cases (`armv7a-none-eabi[hf]`,
       `RUST_SUPPORTED`). Installed both targets via `rustup target add`.
       `dust_dds`, `nros-rmw-dds`, `nros-platform-zephyr`, and `nros`
       compile clean for `armv7a-none-eabi`. zephyr-lang-rust's
       `samples/philosophers` boots cleanly on `qemu_cortex_a9`.
       Documented patch under `scripts/zephyr/cortex-a9-rust-patch.sh`
       (TODO).
       Pick the right triple (`armv7a-none-eabi` vs `armv7a-none-eabihf`),
       install via rustup, confirm `dust_dds` + `nros-rmw-dds` +
       `nros-platform-zephyr` build clean for it. Risk: medium — most
       likely failure mode is x86-isms in 32-bit-pointer-size code or
       the C shim's `socklen_t = usize` assumption.

- [x] 92.2 — `qemu_cortex_a9` board overlay
       Add `boards/qemu_cortex_a9.conf` to `dds/talker` and
       `dds/listener` with `CONFIG_NET_IPV4_IGMP=y`,
       `CONFIG_ETH_XLNX_GEM=y`, distinct static IPs
       (192.0.2.1 / 192.0.2.2), `CONFIG_NET_IF_MCAST_IPV4_ADDR_COUNT=4`,
       and dust-dds-sized heap.

- [ ] 92.3 — `ZephyrProcess::CortexA9` launch variant
       Add CortexA9 to `ZephyrPlatform` in `nros-tests/src/zephyr.rs`.
       Wire `qemu-system-arm -machine arm-generic-fdt-7series -dtb …
       -netdev socket,id=net0,mcast=230.0.0.<N>:<port> -net nic …`.
       Pick a per-test (mcast-group, port) tuple keyed off the test
       binary's PID so concurrent runs of different tests don't bleed.

- [~] 92.4 — Build talker + listener for qemu_cortex_a9
       `west build -b qemu_cortex_a9` succeeds for both binaries.

       **Issue cascade — three Zephyr workspace fixes total**:

       1. ✅ **zephyr-lang-rust** missing Cortex-A9 case. Fixed in
          `modules/lang/rust/CMakeLists.txt` + `modules/lang/rust/Kconfig`
          (~6 LOC each, additive). Toolchain works.
       2. ✅ **Cargo manifest shape**. Edition-2024 / no-build.rs / no
          `zephyr-build` produces silent boot on ARMv7-A (native_sim
          masks it). Migrated DDS examples to `samples/philosophers`
          shape (edition 2021 + `[build-dependencies] zephyr-build` +
          `build.rs` calling `export_bool_kconfig`). 92.4a tracks the
          repo-wide migration of remaining Zephyr Rust examples.
       3. ✅ **Zynq-7000 SoC missing SLCR MMU region**. Without it,
          `eth_xlnx_gem_configure_clocks` data-aborts on
          `sys_read32(0xf8000140)`. Fixed in
          `soc/xlnx/zynq7000/xc7zxxxs/soc.c` by adding a flat MMU
          entry for the SLCR DT node.

       **Current state** (2026-04-26 evening): talker boots through
       Zephyr, prints banner, gets IPv4 address, reaches Rust main,
       prints "nros Zephyr DDS Talker" / "Board: qemu_cortex_a9",
       waits for L4 connectivity (times out as expected — alone),
       then hits a fresh `DATA ABORT` inside
       `compiler_builtins::memcpy` with **dst=NULL**, src=0x100000
       (FLASH base — vector table), n=60.

       **Diagnostic findings** (with `CONFIG_EXTRA_EXCEPTION_INFO=y`
       + `CONFIG_FAULT_DUMP=2` + gdb attached to QEMU):
       * Faulting PC: `0x1f4b58` — inside
         `compiler_builtins::mem::impls::copy_forward::copy_forward_aligned_words`
         at `str r5, [lr], #4` — memcpy uses `lr` as the running
         destination pointer, lr=0 means dst was NULL.
       * Saved registers at fault: r0=0 (dst), r1=0x100000 (src),
         r2=0x3c (n), r5=0xe59ff018 (an ARM `ldr pc, [pc, #0x18]`
         instruction word — confirms src is reading vector table at
         flash base).
       * Original LR clobbered (memcpy's standard prologue uses lr
         as a working register). Caller stack at psp=0x2ad02c is on
         z_arm_sys_stack near the top with mostly zeros — the call
         site doesn't have a normal user-thread stack frame visible.
       * Idle thread's saved psp = `z_idle_stacks+8128` — confirms
         we were running on the kernel-level sys stack at fault, not
         a thread stack.

       The pattern matches a Zephyr-internal call path doing a
       second vector-table relocation (`memcpy(0x0, _vector_start,
       _vector_end - _vector_start)`) that fires after kernel bring-
       up. Our SoC patch maps 0x0–0x1000 with `MPERM_R | MPERM_X`
       (read+execute, no write), so the memcpy succeeds the first
       time but faults if anything tries again. Prime suspect:
       interrupt path or panic-handler trying to refresh VBAR.

       **Verified non-issues**:
       * Cargo dependency closure — minimal (zephyr+log only) builds
         hit the same pattern.
       * `c::addrinfo` Rust layout — matches `zsock_addrinfo` field
         offsets on both 32-bit ARM and 64-bit native.
       * SLCR MMU region — present, GEM driver clock setup completes
         (no abort during `eth_xlnx_gem_configure_clocks`).

       **Resolution (2026-04-26)**: QEMU `-d exec` instruction
       trace + gdb attach confirmed the root cause is **stack
       overflow on the main thread**. Trace excerpt:

           sys_clock_set_timeout / z_add_timeout / z_tick_sleep
           / arch_swap / z_arm_cortex_r_svc / z_arm_svc / z_arm_do_swap
           ... z_arm_int_exit
           [PC=0x00000000]            ← rfeia sp! popped PC=0
           z_arm_reset                ← vector table at 0 dispatched
           ... relocate_vector_table → memcpy(0, _vector_start, 60)
           DATA ABORT (write to R|X-only mapping at 0)

       dust-dds setup overflowed the 32 KiB main stack, clobbering
       the saved interrupt-return PC on the SVC stack. Bumping
       `CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE` from 32 KiB → 128 KiB and enabling
       `CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION=y` + `CONFIG_STACK_SENTINEL=y`
       fixed it. **Talker now reaches steady-state Publish on
       qemu_cortex_a9** (Published: 0..18 in 120 ms sim time).

       **Listener also boots** and parks on "Waiting for messages on
       /chatter".

       **92.5 — partially landed**: locator IPv4 now sourced at build
       time from `CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_ADDR` via a new
       `nros-rmw-dds/build.rs` (reads the path supplied by Zephyr's
       `DOTCONFIG` env var since `rust_cargo_application()` doesn't
       forward arbitrary env vars to cargo). Talker advertises
       192.0.2.1, listener 192.0.2.2.

       **Mcast IGMP join fix**: Zephyr's `ipv4_multicast_group()`
       requires the 12-byte `struct ip_mreqn` (not the Linux 8-byte
       `ip_mreq`). Fixed `nros-platform-zephyr` mcast_listen to use
       the right struct with `imr_ifindex = 0`. Listener now
       successfully joins the SPDP multicast group.

       **Multicast TX fixed (option-2 from earlier diagnosis)**: route
       SPDP / multicast-destined writes through the same socket that
       performed `IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP`. Zephyr's IP layer apparently
       requires that association — sending to `239.255.0.1` from an
       unbound socket "succeeds" (sendto returns the byte count) but
       the frame never leaves the wire. Adding a `mcast_sock` field
       to `NrosMessageWriter` and routing destinations in
       `224.0.0.0/4` through it produces real IPv4-multicast traffic
       on the host mcast group (verified with a Python watcher: 4
       SPDP frames in 10s with `dst=239.255.0.1, dport=7400`).

       **Verified working at the wire**:
       * Talker → mcast: `cargo:rustc-env=NROS_LOCAL_IPV4_BYTES`
         resolves to `192,0,2,1`; outbound SPDP carries
         `dst=239.255.0.1`, `dport=7400`, payload 236 bytes ✓
       * Listener mcast RX: `[mcast_recv_loop] HIT N: 236 bytes` —
         all SPDP frames captured ✓
       * Bidirectional discovery: listener mcast hits=6, talker mcast
         hits=5 over 25 s ✓
       * Bidirectional metatraffic-unicast TX: both talker and
         listener invoke `sendto(192.0.2.X:7410, …)` with success
         (ret = 204 / 224 / 68 bytes) — the SEDP / heartbeat /
         ack-nack chain ✓

       **Remaining blocker — unicast frames don't reach the peer**:
       `unicast_recv_loop` HIT count is 0 on both sides despite
       sendto returning success. dust-dds therefore never matches the
       reader/writer pair, so no sample-data UC sends to port 7411
       happen. Most likely a Zephyr ARP failure or QEMU GEM
       emulation quirk dropping the unicast Ethernet frames despite
       promiscuous-mode (broadcast ARP requests may not be
       traversing the QEMU mcast netdev). Investigation needs
       another session — natural next step is enabling Zephyr's
       `net arp` shell command to inspect the cache, or hardcoding
       static ARP entries on both guests.

       **Bisection results (2026-04-26):** the silent boot was *not* a
       prj.conf issue. Reduced the talker to a near-philosophers
       config (no networking, no POSIX, no nros, just `zephyr` +
       `printkln`) and the binary still didn't boot when:
       * the example's `Cargo.toml` declared `edition = "2024"`, OR
       * the example used a hand-rolled `extern "C" { fn printk(...); }`
         shim instead of `zephyr::printkln!`.
       After matching `samples/philosophers`'s Cargo.toml exactly
       (`edition = "2021"`, `[build-dependencies] zephyr-build`, plus
       a `build.rs` calling `zephyr_build::export_bool_kconfig()`),
       and switching the source to `zephyr::printkln!`, **rust_main
       runs**. So the breaker is somewhere in the
       (edition-2024 / non-zephyr-build / non-printkln) corner that
       all the existing `examples/zephyr/rust/{zenoh,xrce}/…` Cargo
       manifests inherit. Open question: does this break
       `qemu_cortex_a9` only, or does native_sim happen to mask it?
       Native_sim still boots fine with the original config, so the
       interaction is ARMv7-A-specific. Cosmetic: even when
       rust_main runs, the Zephyr boot banner (`*** Booting Zephyr
       OS build v3.7.0 ***`) doesn't appear — suspect chardev mux
       buffering on qemu-system-xilinx-aarch64.

- [ ] 92.5 — Talker↔listener interop validation
       Two QEMU instances on the same mcast group; listener's stdout
       contains `Received: 0` (and ideally `Received: 5` within
       30 s of sim time). Debug SPDP / SEDP / data-path issues.

- [ ] 92.6 — Nextest interop test + serial group
       `test_zephyr_dds_rust_talker_to_listener_e2e` checked into
       `nros-tests/tests/zephyr.rs`. Add a `qemu-zephyr-dds` nextest
       group with `max-threads = 1` so concurrent test runs don't
       fight over the mcast group/port pair.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `cargo test -p nros-tests --test zephyr test_zephyr_dds_rust_talker_to_listener_e2e` passes locally without `sudo` and without any Zephyr SDK patches.
- [ ] Phase 71.8's roadmap entry can flip from `[~]` to `[x]`.
- [ ] No regressions in the existing 27 Zephyr E2E tests (`just zephyr test`).
- [ ] The new test runs under a max-threads=1 nextest group so it can coexist with the rest of the Zephyr suite without mcast-group collisions.

## Notes

### Why qemu_cortex_a9 specifically (vs other QEMU boards)

QEMU board RAM survey for dust-dds (~4 MB heap minimum):

| Board | SRAM | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `qemu_cortex_m3` | 64 KB | Way too small. Stellaris LM3S6965. |
| `qemu_x86` / `qemu_x86_64` | 1 MB | Too small. |
| **`qemu_cortex_a9`** | **512 MB** | Zynq-7000 emulation, Xilinx GEM ethernet. ✓ |
| `qemu_cortex_a53` | 128 MB | AArch64 Cortex-A53. Also fits but adds a 64-bit Rust target. |
| `kvm_arm64` | (host RAM) | Requires KVM on host — not a CI-friendly default. |

`qemu_cortex_a9` is the smallest-friction option that fits dust-dds. AArch64 (`qemu_cortex_a53`) is a fine alternative if the ARMv7-A Rust target turns out to be flaky.

### Why mcast netdev (vs TAP, vs slirp user-mode networking)

| Option | Sudo? | Multicast? | Per-instance isolation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-netdev tap` | yes | yes (host bridges) | needs per-test TAPs + bridge |
| `-netdev user` (slirp) | no | **no — slirp drops mcast** | per-instance NAT |
| **`-netdev socket,mcast`** | **no** | **yes** | per-test (group, port) tuple |

`-netdev user` is the obvious "no sudo" choice but slirp's NAT engine doesn't forward multicast — would silently break SPDP discovery the same way NSOS does. The mcast-socket netdev is the only no-`sudo` option that preserves L2 multicast.

### Per-instance IP addresses

QEMU mcast netdev gives both guests an L2 broadcast domain but doesn't auto-assign IPs. Each guest needs its own static IPv4 in the `prj.conf`'s board overlay. We'll use 192.0.2.1 (talker) and 192.0.2.2 (listener) — consistent with the Zephyr `qemu_cortex_m3` socket samples.

### Mcast group / port collision avoidance

Multiple test runs on the same host could collide if they use the same `(mcast_group, port)`. Plan: pick the port deterministically from a hash of the test binary's process group ID at launch time, or tie it to the existing per-platform port allocator in `nros_tests::platform`. The mcast group can stay fixed (`230.0.0.1`); the port is what scopes the virtual L2 segment.

### What this does NOT cover

- **Real hardware (Zynq, STM32-Eth, ESP32-MAC) DDS deployments** — same code path, but actual hardware bring-up is its own integration cost. Phase 92's test gives high confidence that the cooperative DDS runtime + RTPS bind sequence works against a real Zephyr IP stack; physical-board validation is a separate exercise.
- **Cross-vendor RTPS interop** — Phase 71.9 will exercise CycloneDDS / Fast-DDS against `nros-rmw-dds` once the in-tree pubsub test is green.
- **Performance / latency / throughput numbers** — Phase 92 is correctness-only; numbers belong in a follow-up bench task.

### Why not ship the Phase 71.8 doc with the NSOS patch as the recommended path

Two reasons:
1. NSOS-on-native-sim mirrors the offload-modem topology, which is the *minority* of real DDS-on-Zephyr deployments. Native IP stack is what production runs — we want our regression test on that path.
2. Patching upstream Zephyr puts every contributor on a different SDK from the one `west update` pinned. The QEMU mcast path lives entirely in nano-ros and doesn't drift.
