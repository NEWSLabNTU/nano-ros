//! # nros-board-rtic-stm32f4
//!
//! Phase 216.B.2 — RTIC + STM32F4 board crate. Sibling to the
//! direct-exec [`nros-board-stm32f4`](https://docs.rs/nros-board-stm32f4)
//! crate; both target the same chip family (STM32F4xx, Cortex-M4F)
//! but route the boot lifecycle through different surfaces:
//!
//! - `nros-board-stm32f4` impls
//!   [`nros_platform::BoardEntry::run`] and owns the spin loop.
//! - `nros-board-rtic-stm32f4` (this crate) impls
//!   [`nros_platform::RticBoardEntry`] and hands ownership of the
//!   runtime over to the RTIC framework — `nros::main!()` (Phase
//!   216.B.3) emits a `#[rtic::app]` module that calls
//!   [`RticStm32F4::init_hardware`] from the framework-generated
//!   `#[init]` body, stashes the returned
//!   `(Executor, Runtime)` pair in `#[local]` storage, and routes
//!   signaled callbacks through the [`RticRuntime`] SPSC queue into
//!   an RTIC software task.
//!
//! ## Phase 216.B.2 follow-up — what landed
//!
//! 1. [`RticStm32F4`] unit struct + the four
//!    [`BoardInit`] / [`BoardPrint`] / [`BoardExit`] /
//!    [`RticBoardEntry`] trait impls.
//! 2. The `[package.metadata.nros.board] framework = "rtic"` knob
//!    in `Cargo.toml` so 216.D.1's `nros check` reads the routing.
//! 3. The [`RticStm32F4::DISPATCHERS`] const declaring which RTIC
//!    interrupt slots the proc-macro splices into the generated
//!    `#[rtic::app(dispatchers = …)]` attribute.
//! 4. A working [`RticRuntime`] SPSC machinery — a crate-level
//!    `static mut` [`heapless::spsc::Queue`] holding
//!    `SignaledCallback<'static>` envelopes, a one-shot
//!    [`take_dispatch_queue`] splitter exposing the
//!    `(Producer, Consumer)` halves, and an [`RticRuntime::signal_callback`]
//!    body that calls `Producer::enqueue` and surfaces drops via
//!    `defmt::warn!`. Mirrors the sibling `EmbassyRuntime` shape
//!    (Phase 216.C.2 follow-up) with `heapless::spsc` instead of
//!    `embassy_sync::Channel`.
//! 5. An [`RticRuntime::dispatch_strategy`] returning
//!    [`DispatchStrategy::Deferred`] so 216.D.1's `nros check`
//!    cross-validates each Node pkg's `Node::DISPATCH` against the
//!    deferred surface.
//!
//! ## What's now wired (216.B.2 follow-up bringup)
//!
//! - [`RticBoardEntry::init_hardware`] body — clocks / DWT / sleep
//!   / RMII pin mux / `stm32_eth` / smoltcp Interface + IP +
//!   SmoltcpBridge + network poll-callback wiring all happen
//!   inline. The body delegates to the direct-exec sibling
//!   `nros_board_stm32f4::init_hardware(&Config, device, core)` —
//!   the bringup logic is single-sourced across both board
//!   variants. After hardware is up the body calls
//!   `nros_rmw_zenoh::register()` (bare-metal `.init_array`
//!   doesn't walk auto-register sites) and constructs the
//!   `Executor` via `Executor::open(&ExecutorConfig::new(locator)
//!   .domain_id(domain).node_name("nros"))`. The returned
//!   `(Executor, RticRuntime)` pair lands in RTIC `#[local]`
//!   storage where the macro-emitted `__nros_spin` /
//!   `__nros_dispatch` software tasks own them.
//! - [`RticBoardEntry::Executor`] is the concrete
//!   [`::nros::Executor`] — the assoc-type opacity at the
//!   trait surface (`nros-platform` sits below `nros`) is
//!   resolved at this board layer.
//!
//! ## Still `todo!()`
//!
//! - [`NodeDispatchRuntime::register_dispatch_slot_dyn`] +
//!   [`NodeDispatchRuntime::spin_once`] — they return `Err(())`
//!   today. The proc-macro emit (216.B.3) wraps an
//!   `ExecutorNodeRuntime`-style sink and forwards through; spin is
//!   driven by a framework-spawned RTIC software task pulling from
//!   the [`take_dispatch_queue`] consumer half, not from this
//!   trait method.
//! - The macro-emitted `__nros_spin` task body is still
//!   `core::future::pending` (`packages/core/nros-macros/src/main_macro.rs`,
//!   216.B.3 follow-up). The `Executor` is built here so the
//!   dep graph + macro emit compile against the real
//!   `Self::Executor` type, even though the spin task hasn't
//!   driven it yet.
//! - The bringup starts from `Config::nucleo_f429zi()` (NUCLEO-F429ZI
//!   IP / MAC defaults) and overlays the locator / domain id / node
//!   name from build-time env vars `NROS_LOCATOR` / `NROS_DOMAIN_ID`
//!   / `NROS_NODE_NAME` (resolved via [`option_env!`]) — values flow
//!   through [`nros_platform::BoardConfig::zenoh_locator`] /
//!   [`nros_platform::BoardConfig::domain_id`] so a future
//!   `nros.toml` reader can swap in without touching the call shape.
//!   A follow-up threads the full `nros.toml` `[[transport]]` /
//!   `[node]` plumbing via [`nros_platform::BoardTransportConfig`]
//!   (needs a codegen-driven Entry pkg landing first).
//!
//! ## Layering note
//!
//! `nros-platform` sits below `nros` in the dep graph, which means
//! the [`RticBoardEntry::Executor`] associated type **at the trait
//! surface** cannot be `nros::Executor` (Phase 216.B.1 docs that
//! constraint). Concrete board impls — including this crate —
//! resolve the assoc type at the board layer where pulling `nros`
//! is OK (only the platform / cffi crates have to stay below
//! `nros` in the graph). The pre-followup `Self::Executor = ()`
//! placeholder was a stand-in until the bringup body was ready;
//! the follow-up flips to `Self::Executor = ::nros::Executor`.

///    (`nros::ExecutorNodeRuntime::signal_callback`) hands over a

        //      — that fn brings up clocks (HSE → 168 MHz), DWT

        //      on `DISPATCH_CONSUMER_SLOT`).
        //
        // ### What's still placeholder
        //
        // - `RticRuntime::register_dispatch_slot_dyn` /
        //   `RticRuntime::spin_once` still return `Err(())` — the
        //   proc-macro emit (216.B.3) wraps an
        //   `ExecutorNodeRuntime`-style sink and forwards through.
        // - `Config` is hardcoded to `nucleo_f429zi()`. The
        //   `nros.toml` → `BoardTransportConfig` plumbing is a
        //   separate follow-up; today the locator + IP / MAC come
        //   from the board's default preset.
        // - The macro-emitted `__nros_spin` task body is still
        //   `core::future::pending` (not real `executor.spin_once`);
        //   that lands alongside the per-Node trampoline registration
        //   in the next 216.B wave. The executor is built here so
        //   the macro emit + dep graph compile against the real
        //   `Self::Executor` type, even though the spin task hasn't
        //   driven it yet.

        // Step 1–2: hardware bringup via the direct-exec sibling.
        //
        // Phase 216 follow-up — transport config (locator / domain_id /
        // node name) comes from build-time env vars via [`option_env!`]
        // with a fallback to the board's `Config::nucleo_f429zi()`
        // defaults (which already impl `nros_platform::BoardConfig` +
        // `BoardTransportConfig`). The env-var seam is the pragmatic
        // interim between the previous hardcoded
        // `tcp/127.0.0.1:7447` (now removed — the fallback comes from
        // the board `Config`) and a full `nros.toml` →
        // [`nros_platform::BoardTransportConfig`] reader (which needs
        // a codegen-driven Entry pkg landing first).
        //
        // The override knobs:
        //
        //   - `NROS_LOCATOR` — overrides `config.zenoh_locator` (the
        //     `BoardConfig::zenoh_locator()` accessor)
        //   - `NROS_DOMAIN_ID` — overrides `config.domain_id` (parsed
        //     decimal, matching `Config::from_toml`)
        //   - `NROS_NODE_NAME` — overrides the previously hardcoded
        //     `"nros"` node name on `ExecutorConfig`
        //
